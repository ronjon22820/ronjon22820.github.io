# About Me

This project is about of host things I've just begun to learn more about.  The software arena is vast and wide, with so much to learn and so little time to learn it. 
From learning basic terminology, the massive number of acronyms, the variety of languages, operating systems, IDE's and now cloud platforms. The list goes on an on...
I do enjoy computer science and being apart of its evolution, which began from the hardware side.

My interest in software began after bulding my first 3D printer. After you've dialed in your prints and become more familiar with its functionality. You get the desire to bring something into this world that no one has ever seen.  That ability was just too much to pass on.  In order to do that you need to learn how to design your own drawings.  That's
were I got hooked with a CAD program called [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) which is a free and open source 3D CAD program built off of Python.   

Blender is a very powerful program that not only allows you to design but animate as well.  I didn't use half of its functionality, but became more intersted in the software language used to create it.  Then from Python to Data Science through DataCamp. Whom introduced me to machine learning.  Now I'm studying blochchain and web developement. 
Which brings me to why I'm here now. To learn Git and version control workflow along with Visual Studio Code and how they operate and function together.
